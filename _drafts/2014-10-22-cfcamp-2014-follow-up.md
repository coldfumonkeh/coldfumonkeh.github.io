## CFCamp 2014

Monkeh Works were at <a href="http://cfcamp.org" target="_blank">CFCamp</a> in Munich giving a presentation on using Grunt and Gulp JavaScript task runners in your applications to streamline your workflow.

Big thanks go to <a href="http://www.bluegras.de" target="_blank">Bluegras.de</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/madmike_de" target="_blank">@madmike_de</a> for organising another great EU CFML event.


### Venue

Once again the event was held at the Stadthalle in Germering, a fantastic venue with plenty of space, seating and atmosphere.

### Sponsors

A great turn out of sponsors this year with some really useful tool and services on offer.

Pixl8 were in force with their PresideCMS, also running a side session to allow delegates to investigate and explore the CMS a little further. They are doing some really nice stuff with this product and as it's on Github you can add to it too.

Intergral showed me their cloud-based FusionReactor demo. I've known this was in the pipeline and was excited to finally see it running. The interface alone is stunning and incredibly easy to navigate. The ability to dig into stack traces, requests, page and application-specific issues and have everything backed up to the cloud is immense.




### Nice Touches

One of the sponsors was an American Chiropractic clinic based in Munich who offered free chiropractic exams and treatment to all attendees who signed up for it. We all sit at desks and on the whole posture is not great for many of us, so this was a really nice touch to have as a free extra. 10-15 minutes of popping various parts of your body back into place and everyone left the room with a smile on their face and a skip in their step.
