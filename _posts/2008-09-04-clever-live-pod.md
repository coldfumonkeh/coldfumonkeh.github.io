<p>Tomorrow (Friday 5th September) at 8pm <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">GMT</span> BST heralds a new era in British Podcasting with a live version of my favourite podcast, <a title="Clever Little Pod" href="http://www.cleverlittlepod.com" target="_blank">Clever Little Pod</a>.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to watching the show live. It's always full of great comedy and some fantastic podsafe tunes. The live show may bring a few surprises as well, and I'm hoping that (sorry Gary) a few minor 'gaffs' along the way will add to the entertainment.</p>
<p>It's such a great venture and an exciting project, so I hope everyone will log on to <a title="Clever Little Pod" href="http://www.cleverlittlepod.com" target="_blank">www.cleverlittlepod.com</a> tomorrow night at 8pm <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">GMT</span> BST to enjoy the show.</p>
