<p>I was listening to some tunes the other night whilst working (nothing too out of the ordinary there) and one song has been playing in my head for a while - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Discovery-Daft-Punk/dp/B00005A9ZC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1266626244&sr=8-1" target="_blank" title="Check out the album 'Disovery' on Amazon">Daft Punk's "Harder Better Faster Stronger"</a>.</p>
<p>An awesome tune, I think you'll agree, and one that I thought would be fun to make a short video with. </p>
<p>The code used to create the video was working from four implicitly created arrays, and all of the structures, queries and XML were created by reading and looping over the data structures containing the lyric portions to build the lyrics to display on screen. </p>
<p>I had originally filmed the short movie 'live' - I was fliming the browser and refreshing the page in time with the music to load up the next slide.<br />
This worked really well, but the quality of the finished movie was absolute rubbish, so I ended up taking screenshots.</p>
<p>I may post the code at another time (I even created a small CFC called 'daftMonkeh' to handle some reusable functions) but for now, here's the video. I hope you enjoy.</p>
