<p>I am thrilled, overjoyed and immensely proud to announce the arrival of my son, Edward <a title="The meaning of Wiremu" href="http://www.behindthename.com/name/wiremu" target="_blank">Wiremu</a> Wood Gifford, born on 2nd February.</p>
<p>He kept us waiting for almost 42 weeks, but since his arrival the gorgeous healthy boy has made the world a much brighter place.</p>
