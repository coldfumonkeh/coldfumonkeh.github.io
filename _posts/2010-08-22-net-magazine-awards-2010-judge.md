<p>A very exciting year indeed so far, and with thanks to the guys at <a title="Visit the .net Magazine site" href="http://www.netmag.co.uk/" target="_blank">.net magazine</a> it keeps getting better.</p>
<p>I have been asked to join the judging panel for the 2010 .net magazine awards, which is a fantastic opportunity. The <a title="See the complete list of judges for the .net magazine awards 2010" href="http://www.thenetawards.com/judges.php" target="_blank">list of judges</a> is quite an extensive one, and some top names in the development community are instantly recognisable in the line up.</p>
<p>If you haven't done so already, head over to the <a title="Visit the .net Magazine Awards 2010 site" href="http://www.thenetawards.com/" target="_blank">.net Magazine Awards 2010</a> to cast your votes for the entries in each category.</p>
