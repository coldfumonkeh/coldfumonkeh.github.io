Issue 228 of Web Designer magazine is now available in the shops, in which you will find a four-page tutorial covering how to build awesome static HTML sites using Node and the immense Metalsmith package.

This is part one of a two part tutorial, both of which were co-authored with <a href="misterdai.yougeezer.co.uk" target="_blank">David Boyer</a> who first introduced me to the Metalsmith project.

The tutorial guides the reader through the installation of required libraries and packages, setting up a local environment and running the tasks via the command line to compile your code from Markdown into the required HTML structures.
