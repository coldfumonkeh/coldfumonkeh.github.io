<p>Sale of the century!! Well, April and May anyway..</p>
<p>Fuzzy Orange Ltd are offering a free copy of ColdFusion Builder bundled with every ColdFusion 9 Enterprise license purchased between 1st April and 31st May 2010.</p>
<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
<p>It means, dear reader, that you get a kick ass development language AND the development IDE written specifically for that language..</p>
<p>This alone is a fantastic bundle, and one which is not being offered anywhere else in the world!</p>
<p>It's even better if you add into the equation the simple fact that Flash Builder 4 Standard is also thrown in as part of the overall bundle (as it ships with ColdFusion Builder) so you get two amazing development tools and the server application to run them on.</p>
<p>Head over to the <a title="Fuzzy Orange ColdFusion Bundle" href="http://www.fuzzyorange.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2010/3/31/ColdFusion-Enterprise-Builder-Bundle-Offer" target="_blank">Fuzzy Orange blog post</a> for more information.</p>
