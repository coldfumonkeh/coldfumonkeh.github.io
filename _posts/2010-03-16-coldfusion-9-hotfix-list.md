<p>Following on from the release of the <a title="Cumulative Hot Fix 1" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/coldfusion-9-cumulative-hot-fix-1/">Cumulative Hot Fix 1</a> in February, Adobe have published a page within the Technote section of their site to list all hotfixes for ColdFusion 9:</p>
<p><a title="ColdFusion 9 : List of Hotfixes" href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/529/cpsid_52967.html" target="_blank">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/529/cpsid_52967.html</a></p>
<p>Sadly, as RSS feed for the releases does not yet exist, which would be uber-helfpul, but make sure you bookmark the link to ensure you stay up to date on hot fix releases for ColdFusion 9.</p>
