<p>I was looking forward to today (despite it being a Monday, and a hectic application release this morning), as it is the first of December.</p>
<p>Which means that it's time to start visiting <a title="24 Ways" href="http://24ways.org/" target="_blank">http://24ways.org/</a> again.</p>
<p>24ways is basically an advent calendar for geeks. Every day a new article is added, complete with source code (where relevant), and has often provided some great resources for me over the years.</p>
<p>I found this site in 2005 when it started, and have made it part of my daily December routine to check out every year. Forget your chocolate-filled advent calendar (if you want to put on weight over December, just check out my <a title="Weight Control" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/blog/?p=48" target="_self">previous post</a>), and look at <a title="24 Ways" href="http://24ways.org/" target="_blank">http://24ways.org/</a> instead.</p>
