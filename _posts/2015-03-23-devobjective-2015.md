Following on from [last week's post](/into-the-box) about the [Into The Box](http://www.intothebox.org) conference I am incredibly excited to announce that I will be attending and speaking at [dev.Objective() 2015](http://www.devobjective.com)

Monkeh Works have been present at two cf.Objective() conferences in the past and each one has been incredible. I am really looking forward to this year's event, meeting new people and catching up with familiar faces whilst out there.

As for the content I will be giving the following sessions:

**[API Management from the Trenches](http://www.devobjective.com/sessions/api-management-from-the-trenches/)**

and

**[Get Grulping with JavaScript Task Runners](http://www.devobjective.com/sessions/get-grulping-with-javascript-task-runners/)**


The conference is packed with fantastic [sessions](http://www.devobjective.com/sessions/) from an amazing selection of [speakers](http://www.devobjective.com/speakers/). As with most **.objective() conferences I think it's going to be a really tricky decision to choose what to attend as all of the sessions look fantastic.

Keep up to date with the latest [news](http://www.devobjective.com/news/) from the conference or [follow @devobjective](https://twitter.com/devobjective) on Twitter and most importantly make sure you say hello at the conference!
