<p>I have just finished editing and publishing the <a title="CFHour episode 206" href="http://www.cfhour.com/post.cfm/show-206-mucho-happy-box" target="_blank">last CFHour show as official producer</a>. I have loved every minute of being involved with the show, and Dave and Scott have made it a truly entertaining experience.</p>
<p>My first show was <a title="CFHour episode 120" href="http://cfhour.com/post.cfm/show-120-coldspring-with-mark-mandel" target="_blank">#120, "ColdSpring with Mark Mandel"</a> in 2011. I would have loved to have made it to an even 100 shows before passing over production duties, but time limitations meant it was not possible and so I had to finish on <a title="CFHour episode 206" href="http://www.cfhour.com/post.cfm/show-206-mucho-happy-box" target="_blank">#206</a> - 86 is not a bad figure!</p>
<p>My reasons for leaving are pretty much down to time. This year I am working on a number of projects, and the following are all on my list of current or "soon to be current" activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>learning French</li>
<li>writing book number 3</li>
<li>planning book number 4</li>
<li>running a business</li>
<li>dealing with external clients (which equates to two full time jobs)</li>
<li>five kids</li>
<li>magazine tutorials</li>
<li>conference presentation preparation</li>
<li>planning to start my University degree and aim towards a Masters</li>
<li>sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly something had to give, and CFHour was that something. It was a really hard decision to make and I didn't want to let it go, but for the sake of sanity and trying to find some time to sleep amongst everything else mentioned above I had to.</p>
<p>Some fun stats for anyone interested. During my time as producer I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>listened to approximately 134 hours of audio</li>
<li>created approximately 430 minutes of bloopers</li>
<li>taken part in two live shows</li>
<li>spliced, blanked out and removed approximately 258 minutes of audio</li>
<li>destroyed more audio gems that will never / should never see the light of day!</li>
</ul>
<p>I can honestly say I have had massive fun working on the show. Dave and Scott gave me free reign to do whatever I wanted, and I can happily say that they are two very close friends of mine.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has listened to the show and continues to listen. It's the #1 ColdFusion podcast and long may it stay so. Please continue to support the show and I look forward to making the occasional appearance in the future - I'll be able to relax if I do, as I wont have to edit it afterwards! ;)</p>
<p>monkeh out!</p>
