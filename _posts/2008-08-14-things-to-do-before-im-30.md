<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19 alignright" style="float: right;" title="Things to do before I\'m 30" src="/assets/uploads/2008/08/30sign.jpg" alt="Things to do before I\'m 30" />I've been thinking over the past few days about things I'd like to achieve in life before I reach the grand old age of 30. I've decided to create a <a title="My pre-30 wish list" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/blog/?page_id=17">list</a> on here to keep track of them, and to cross them off as they are done.</p>
<p>I'll be adding to the list when I think of more tasks, but <a title="My pre-30 wish list" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/blog/?page_id=17">these</a> will do for now.</p>
