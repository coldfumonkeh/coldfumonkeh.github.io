<p>I'm really excited and honoured to say that I will be speaking at the <a title="Future of Web Design 2011" href="http://futureofwebdesign.com/london-2011/" target="_blank">Future of Web Design 2011</a> conference in London on Tuesday 17th May.</p>
<p>Organised by <a title="Carsonified" href="http://carsonified.com/" target="_blank">Carsonified</a>, the FOWD events are a fantastic way to meet new people, find inspiration from the range of topics and speakers, and get creative with sessions, labs and workshops.</p>
<p>If you're going, I'll see you there!</p>
