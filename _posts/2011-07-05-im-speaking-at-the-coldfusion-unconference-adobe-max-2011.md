<p>I'm delighted to announce that I'll be speaking this year at the ColdFusion Unconference at Adobe MAX.</p>
<p>This is my second year in a row both at MAX and speaking at the unconference, and I'm really looking forward to it!</p>
<p>Ray (Camden, who else) recently <a title="Visit coldfusionjedimaster.com to see the initial list of speakers" href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2011/7/3/Initial-list-of-speakers-and-sessions-for-the-ColdFusion-Unconference" target="_blank">posted the initial list of speakers</a>, and there is a great line up so far from some exceptional community members covering some great topics.</p>

<p>My session title listed in the post was the working title (aka the brain dump) I sent over to Ray as my submission. I considered changing the title to something a little 'snappier' but have decided against it as I dont think there can any confusion over what the session will cover:</p>
<p><strong>"OWASP Enterprise Security API and available methods to help lock down a ColdFusion application"</strong></p>
<p>No guessing about the content there!</p>
<p>So, if you're going to MAX, make sure you stop by the ColdFusion Unconference sessions and say hello.Â A big thank you to Ray, Ezra (Parker) and Scott (Stroz) for selecting my session and having me back again.</p>
