<p>I'm speaking tonight at the <a title="Visit the Sheffield Adobe User Group site" href="http://www.shauguk.co.uk/" target="_blank">Sheffield Adobe User Group</a> (SHAUGUK) meeting, where I'll be bringing with me a whole monkeh-load of ColdFusion love.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to meeting new people and catching up with some familiar faces. If you're in the Sheffield area, or dont mind a mild trek for an evening of entertainment, geek-talk and beer, make sure you <a title="Register with eventbrite" href="http://sheffieldadobe1011.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">register for your free ticket</a> and come along :)</p>
