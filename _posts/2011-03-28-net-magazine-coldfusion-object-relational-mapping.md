<p>In this month's issue (May 2011 - issue 214), <a title="Visit net magazine" href="http://www.netmagazine.com/" target="_blank">net magazine</a> have opened up a brand new 16-page feature to focus more of server-side tutorials and articles, and I'm very happy to say it features my three-page tutorial, an introduction to Object Relational Mapping (ORM) in ColdFusion 9.</p>
