<p>Yesterday saw the launch of a brand new online project; a unique blog / portal combining music and Rich Internet Application technology.</p>
<p><a title="Visit codebass.net" href="http://codebass.net/" target="_blank">Codebass.net</a> is the brainchild of <a title="Follow Vicky on Twitter @fuzie" href="http://twitter.com/fuzie" target="_blank">Vicky Ryder</a>, the talent behind <a title="Visiti socialwebeditor.com" href="http://socialwebeditor.com/" target="_blank">socialwebeditor.com</a> and <a title="Visit vickycooks.com" href="http://vickycooks.com/" target="_blank">vickycooks.com</a>, and aims to showcase and highlight developers / musicians whose skill set and interests overlap and meld into one.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Codebass" src="http://codebass.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Codebassv4.jpg" alt="Codebass" /></p>
<p>I was incredibly honoured to be asked to contribute to one of the inaugural posts with some of the work I have done creating an <a title="Visit codebass.net to read about the Gimpify Premium AIR application" href="http://codebass.net/2010/06/20/matt-gifford/" target="_blank">AIR music player application</a>, and am featured alongside the very talented <a title="Visit Matt @ multitouchup.com" href="http://multitouchup.com/" target="_blank">Matt LeGrand</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure you check out the posts and information Codebass has to offer; I'm sure that this site will grow into something big, and will be inundated with entries and requests from visitors and contributors within a very short space of time.</p>
