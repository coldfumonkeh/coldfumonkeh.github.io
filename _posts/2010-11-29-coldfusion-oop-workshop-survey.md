<p>Following on from the release of my first book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/object-oriented-programming-in-coldfusion/book">Object Orientated Programming in ColdFusion</a>, I have received a lot of enquiries and interest in a workshop / course covering the basics of using OOP within ColdFusion.</p>
<p>As such, there are currently discussions and ideas for a User Group or Workshop tour on this same topic. The tour would be focused within the UK and Europe and, wherever possible, ideally it would be integrated with the local User Group.</p>
<p>In a bid to better understand people's requirements and expectations from a course like this, I would be really grateful if you could take 2 minutes to answer a few very simple questions. Thank you very much :)</p>
