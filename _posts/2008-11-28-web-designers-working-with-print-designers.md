<p>I found this on twitter, courtesy of <a title="http://andrewduck.name" href="http://andrewduck.name" target="_blank">Andrew Duck</a>, who found <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/7fu6x/if_youre_a_web_designer_working_alongside_print/c06jlj1" target="_self">this gem</a> on <a title="http://www.reddit.com" href="http://www.reddit.com" target="_blank">reddit.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you're a web designer working alongside print designers with little to no web design/dev knowledge, how is your experience?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Teeth-grindingly annoying.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Print-turned-web designers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn the medium you're working in. A five minute video of even the best print advert makes for a lousy TV advert. Likewise, techniques and habits refined by years of print design are often sub-optimal or <em>flatly counter-productive</em> when applied to the web.</li>
<li>For the love of god, give up on pixel-perfect positioning and learn to appreciate flow layout. Sure, it makes design harder... but if you think designing flow layouts is hard, think about us poor schmucks who have to <em>implement</em> the damn things. And if you think flow layouts are ugly, let's see how good your precious pixel-perfect design works when I do something freakishly unusual like <em>resize my browser window</em>.</li>
<li>Print pages are Things To Look At. Web sites are Things To Use. Prioritising aesthetics over usability or functionality is like putting a car steering wheel in the middle of the dashboard "because it looks nicer there". You think it's pretty and a real design coup, but everyone else is laughing at your idiocy (... or swearing at it if the design ever gets into production). Incidentally, I swear if I get one more design through with a "button" image but no <em>pressed</em> button image (or "link" style but no "active/hover/visited" link style) I will personally bite off your head and defecate into your body-cavity. You have been warned.</li>
<li>Conventions are not boring - conventions are <em>your friend</em>.  Putting light-switches near doors is a convention.  Sure, putting them square in the middle of the ceiling is <em>innovative</em>, but then so is cheesegrating your knees (hey - do <em>you</em> know anyone who's done it?). Innovative means "nobody else is doing it". Accept the possibility that nobody else is doing it because <em>it's a fucking stupid idea</em>.</li>
<li>I don't want to "explore the interface". I want to get in, do my shit and get out again. If you think forcing users to explore the interface is such a good idea, try ripping the labels off all the cans of food in your cupboard. A couple of meals of cat-food, chilli and peaches should demonstrate exactly how "fun" this is.</li>
</ul>
