### Best Practices are Best, Except When They're Not - Nolan Erck

* Dealing with clients (and legacy code)
  * draw a line in the sand
  * 80/20 rule (good, cheap or quick)
* What is best practice?
  * best practices change often
* good practices _may_ be better than best practices
* technical debt is a consideration
* sometimes the work just _has_ to get done

### Event Gateways - Gert Franz

* Additional communication tool, not necessarily over HTTP
* Something that triggers an event
* Listeners are executed upon an event
* Examples:
  * Instant messages
  * IRC
  * Active MQ messenger
  * Directory watcher
  * Mail watcher
  * ANY custom CFML event gateway
* How this works:
  * message generator
  * event gateway (Java or Railo)
  * event gateway services (CF or Railo)
  * listener CFC
* Application types (in CF)
  * Listener apps
    * Listener CFC called hy gateway instance
    * Method specified in configuration is called
    * CFEvent structure passed as argument
  * Listener CFC
    * Contains methods for handling events
    * Option <code>cfreturn</code> response
* Config gateway (in CF)
  * Create config file
  * Build CFC with appropriate methods etc
  * lots of settings (watched directory, recursion settings, intervals etc)
* Problems with event gateways
  * complicated (overly so)
  * typically Java-based
* Railo lets you write Event Gateways in Java or CFML
* existing gateways in Railo:
  * Directory Watcher
  * Mail Watcher
* easily managed through the Railo administrator
