<p>Freshly pushed kicking and screaming into the big wide open, the MTV Networks CFC is now available for download from the project page over at RIA Forge: <a title="(I want my) MTV RIA Forge project page" href="http://iwantmymtv.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">http://iwantmymtv.riaforge.org/</a></p>
<p>The basic demo page can still be viewed here: <a title="MTVN CFC Wrapper Demo" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/projects/MTVN/" target="_blank">http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/projects/MTVN/</a></p>
<p>If you use it, let me know. It would be great to see what people come up with.</p>
