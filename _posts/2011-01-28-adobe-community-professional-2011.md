<p>I awoke this fine morning to a fantastic email in the inbox, informing me that my status as an Adobe Community Professional for ColdFusion had been renewed for 2011!</p>
<p>This is <a title="Matt Gifford - Adobe Community Professional 2010" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/adobe-community-professional/" target="_self">my second year as a member</a> of this amazing programme, and I am honoured and incredibly excited to be included. My thanks go out to Liz Frederick and all at the Adobe Community Programme for their constant hard work and support for community members.</p>
<p>For me, 2010 was an incredibly busy and exciting year, made even more special as my first year as an ACP. I am looking forward to continuing my efforts in 2011 and creating more content, articles and published works as well as speaking slots and presentations than last year's busy schedule.</p>
<p>I would also like to extend a warm welcome and congratulations to all <a title="Adobe Community Professional Members 2011" href="http://blogs.adobe.com/community/2011/01/adobe-community-professionals-2011.html" target="_blank">Adobe Community Professional (ACP)</a> members, new and old, and to those who have been selected for the new <a title="Adobe Community Champions 2011" href="http://blogs.adobe.com/community/2011/01/adobe-community-champions-2011.html" target="_blank">Adobe Community Champion (ACC) Â programe</a>. The Adobe community is and has always been an incredibly warm, friendly environment filled with helpful, knowledgeable individuals, and so as such it's a pleasure to be associated with you all again!</p>
<p>Here's to an amazing 2011!</p>
