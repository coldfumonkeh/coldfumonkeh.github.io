<p>Adobe MAX is almost upon as and I am gearing up for the trip out to Los Angeles to revel in all things geeky and Adobe-tech. I'm going to be a busy monkeh whilst out there with three sessions, details of which are below.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to going out again, and catching up with friends old and new. Come and find me at the ColdFusion Unconference booth and say hello, or better yet attend my BYOD LAB and get started with mobile application development powered by ColdFusion.</p>

<h3>OWASP Enterprise Security API and available methods to help lock down a ColdFusion application</h3>
<p>An introduction to the OWASP ESAPI project and it's methods and processes you can use to help lock down and secure your ColdFusion applications.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> Monday October 3rd 2:00pm - 2:50pm</p>

<h3>Mobile Apps from 0 to 90: Powered by ColdFusion</h3>
<p>In this 90 minute lab, you'll use Adobe Flash Builder to develop a mobile application from the ground up, compiling it as an Adobe AIR app. Learn how to create and push views, add a tabbed menu interface, and call and manage remote data from a ColdFusion web server. You'll also debug and deploy the final application to your mobile Android device.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> Tuesday October 4th 08:00am - 09:30am</p>

<h3>Darwin Development</h3>
<p>Evolution. It’s a wonderful thing, and something that needs to occur for natural progression and the continuing advancement of ideas. As we see the modern trends, development paradigms and design practices evolve into different areas utilizing newer technologies, should we really be saying goodbye to our old ways in favour of the new approach? Join Matt Gifford as he invites you to partake in a presentation with an emphasis on attendee input in a discussion to help understand what makes the web great, how we communicate in the modern world, and as a result whether or not we should leave the big screen behind entirely in favour of new formats.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> Wednesday October 5th 1:30pm - 2:00pm</p>
