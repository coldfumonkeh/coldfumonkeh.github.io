<p>Now that the session is officially listed on the MAX scheduler, I can now proudly announce that I will be speaking at Adobe MAX 2011 in October.</p>
<p>The session itself is a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) lab session titled "<a title="Visit the &quot;Mobile Apps from 0 to 90: Powered by ColdFusion&quot; session details on the Adobe MAX scheduler" href="https://max.adobe.com/schedule/by-session/#Speaker=4df7942b8d5362e15400009a wefwe" target="_blank">Mobile Apps from 0 to 90: Powered by ColdFusion</a>". Here's what you can expect from the lab:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this 90 minute lab, you'll use Adobe Flash Builder to develop a mobile application from the ground up, compiling it as an Adobe AIR app. Learn how to create and push views, add a tabbed menu interface, and call and manage remote data from a ColdFusion web server. You'll also debug and deploy the final application to your mobile Android device.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm really excited to be back again this year and sharing some of the Flash Builder / AIR / mobile / ColdFusion love. Time to charge the laptops, prepare the coffee and get ready to start building awesome mobile applications!</p>
