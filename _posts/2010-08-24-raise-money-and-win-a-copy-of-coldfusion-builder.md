<p>For any who have not yet seen, Russ Johnson (<a title="Follow Russ on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/russ_johnson" target="_blank">@russ_johnson</a> on Twitter) fellow ColdFusion ACP, community member and all-round good-guy is taking up a fantastic personal challenge and raising money for a superb cause at the same time.</p>
<p>Russ will be cycling 150 miles for a fundraising event for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and needs your help! For every $5 donation you make to sponsor the bike ride, your name will be entered into a prize draw with the chance to win a copy of ColdFusion Builder (which includes Flash Builder 4 Standard); $20 donated and you'll be entered into the draw four times.</p>
<p>Check out the <a title="View Russ' post about the fundraiser" href="http://angry-fly.com/post.cfm/win-a-copy-of-cfbuilder" target="_blank">official post on Russ' site</a>, and drop him a few $$. You can do without that seventh frappuccino today.</p>
