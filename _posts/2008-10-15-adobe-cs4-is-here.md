<p>Adobe have announced the release of the new suite of design packages, <a title="View the CS4 features" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite" target="_blank">CS4</a>.</p>
<p>I've had the opportunity to play around with Fireworks CS4 last week, and love the built in CSS creation when exporting a layout into HTML. Looking at the new features in Dreamweaver CS4, the package will continue to make the life of developers everywhere that little bit easier, with the addition of things like live view editing and deeper integration with Photoshop and the rest of the suite packages.</p>
<p>Flash 10 has also been released today, so update your player to the <a title="Flash Player 10" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer" target="_blank">new version</a>.</p>
<p>Right, I'm off to save up a few hundred pounds to actually buy the damn package...</p>
