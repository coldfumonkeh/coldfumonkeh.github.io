<p>A year certainly goes by too quickly.</p>
<p>Scotch on the Rocks 2011 is rapidly bearing down upon us, and will be THE European ColdFusion conference to attend in 2011 on 3rd and 4th March. The event is also returning to it's spiritual home in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
<p>I have updated the <a title="SOTR 2010 Wordpress Plugin" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/sotr-2010-wordpress-plugin/">Wordpress widget plugin developed last year</a> to quickly and easily display your choice of promotional badge into your blog's sidebar.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install the plugin, simply upload and unzip the archive file into the wp-content/plugins directory on your site, and activate the plugin from the plugin list in the Wordpress admininstration section.</p>
<p>Applying the widget to the sidebar is a case of dragging it into the sidebar placeholder.</p>

<p>To customise the widget, you can add an optional title which will display above the image in your sidebar.</p>
<p>Select from one of the pre-defined images to display on your site, and change the image dimensions to suit and to fit into the look and feel of your blog.</p>

<p>That’s all there is to it!</p>
