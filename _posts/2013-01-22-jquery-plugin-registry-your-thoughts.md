<p>Last week I was asked my opinion by one of the feature writers at .net Magazine about the jQuery Plugin Registry.</p>
<p>Some of my thoughts can be read in the resulting article, available here:Â <a title="New plug-in registry boosts jQuery - via netmagazine.com" href="http://www.netmagazine.com/news/new-plug-registry-boosts-jquery-132508" target="_blank">http://www.netmagazine.com/news/new-plug-registry-boosts-jquery-132508</a></p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the jQuery Plugin Registry? A good move? Long overdue? Unnecessary? Post a comment to this entry and let me know your thoughts.</p>
