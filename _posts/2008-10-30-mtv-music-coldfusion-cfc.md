<p>I've been keeping myself busy the last few nights having fun creating a ColdFusion CFC wrapper for use with the <a title="MTVN API" href="http://developer.mtvnservices.com/" target="_blank">MTV Networks API</a>.</p>
<p>My main aim was to create a CFC that would bring back as much combined detail for the user as possible, all contained within a structure and arrays within. I am really happy with the results so far, and look forward to working on it to tidy it up, add more features, and release it to the big wide open(source). :)</p>
<p>A sample of the project CF in action can be found on the project page: <a title="MTVN CFC Wrapper" href="http://mattgifford.co.uk/projects/MTVN/">http://mattgifford.co.uk/projects/MTVN/</a>.</p>
<p>I can see so many possibilities for this API, and although the wealth of content may not be as great as perhaps perceptions of MTV would have you think, there's still plenty out there to be useful in creating something fun.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the release date of the CFC.</p>
