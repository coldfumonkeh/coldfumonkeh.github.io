<p><a style="margin-right: 8px;" href="/assets/uploads/2009/05/whisky.png"><img title="Scotch on the Road 2009" src="/assets/uploads/2009/05/whisky.png" alt="Scotch on the Road 2009" /></a><a title="Scotch on the Road 2009" href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/" target="_blank">Scotch on the Road 2009</a> begins in London on June 1st at the Sway Bar, Great Queen Street, and the three day ColdFusion, Flex and AIR conference promises to be packed with fantastic sessions from some great speakers. The event will then move to Manchester's TigerTiger at The Printworks on June 3rd, and the last session will be held at The Caves, Niddry Street South in Ediburgh on June 5th.</p>
<p>The guys at Fuzzy Orange have done a superb job organising a great event at some brilliant venues, and I'm really looking forward to attending.</p>
<p>Some of the speakers at the event include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter Bell</li>
<li>Mark Drew</li>
<li>Andy Allan</li>
<li>Big Kev McCabe</li>
<li>Gert Franz</li>
<li>Peter Elst</li>
<li>Adam Lehman</li>
<li>David Rutter</li>
</ul>
<p>A wide range of topics and subject matter will be covered, including sessions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced ORM in ColdFusion 9</li>
<li>Building RIAs</li>
<li>Securing ColdFusion Applications</li>
<li>Railo in the Cloud</li>
<li>ColdFusion is dead. Or is it? (no conference would be without this topical debate)</li>
</ul>
<p>Grab yourself a ticket, enjoy the sessions and learn something new. Tickets are available from the <a title="Buy tickets for Scotch on the Road 2009" href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/index.cfm?do=tickets.view" target="_blank">Scotch on the Road</a> site, and you'll find me somewhere at the London event on Monday 1st June, so feel free to come and say hello. :)</p>
