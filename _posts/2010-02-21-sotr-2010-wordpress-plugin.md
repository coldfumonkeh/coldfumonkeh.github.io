<p>The badgers are on the march again, and the 2010 Scotch on the Rocks conference will be with us very soon.</p>
<p>To celebrate and to promote the event, I have developed a Wordpress widget plugin for any WP blog users out there.</p>
<p>The plugin allows the user to select which SOTR10 badge they wish to display on the site, and will place it into the sidebar.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install the plugin, simply upload and unzip the archive file into the wp-content/plugins directory on your site, and activate the plugin from the plugin list in the Wordpress admininstration section.</p>
<p>Applying the widget to the sidebar is a case of dragging it into the sidebar placeholder.</p>
<p><img title="Install the SOTR 2010 Widget" src="/assets/uploads/2010/02/installWidget.gif" alt="Install the SOTR 2010 Widget" /></p>
<p>To customise the widget, you can add an optional title, which will display above the image.</p>
<p>Select from one of the pre-defined images to display on your site, and change the image dimensions to suit and to fit into the look and feel of your blog.</p>
<p><img title="Edit the SOTR 2010 Widget" src="/assets/uploads/2010/02/editWidget.gif" alt="Edit the SOTR 2010 Widget" /></p>
<p>That's all there is to it!</p>
<p>If you have a Wordpress blog, make sure you <a title="Download the SOTR2010 Wordpress Widget Plugin" href="http://www.monkehworks.com/downloads/SOTR10/scotch2010_BadgeWidget.zip" target="_blank">download the plugin</a> and put it to good use.</p>
<p>Guust Nieuwenhuis has developed a similar <a title="Visit Guust's site for the Mango Blog SOTR 2010 plugin" href="http://www.lagaffe.be/post.cfm/sotr-2010-badges" target="_blank">plugin for Mango Blog users</a>, which you should definitely grab if you run Mango Blog.</p>
