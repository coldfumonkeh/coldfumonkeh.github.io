<p>It has been a while since I've held a monkehTime competition or giveaway so it's time I started again, and this is a BIG one!</p>
<p>I have <strong>one</strong> conference pass to this year's <a title="cf.Objective() 2013" href="http://cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a> conference in Bloomington, MN to give away. Yup, that's a free ticket to the conference!</p>
<p>If you haven't been before, this is an incredible event packed full of amazing <a title="cf.Objective() 2013 Sessions" href="http://cfobjective.com/sessions/" target="_blank">sessions</a> and tracks. The <a title="cf.Objective() 2013 Schedule" href="http://cfobjective.com/schedule/" target="_blank">schedule</a> is full and I'm really looking forward to attending and speaking again this year!</p>
<p>To be in with a chance to win, all you need to do is write a comment on this blog post with a reason why you want to go to cf.Objective(). Perhaps there are certain sessions you want to see, particular <a title="cf.Objective() 2013 Speakers" href="http://cfobjective.com/speakers/" target="_blank">speakers</a> you want to meet orÂ <a title="cf.Objective() 2013 Sponsors" href="http://cfobjective.com/sponsors/" target="_blank">sponsors</a> you want to chat with.</p>
<p>You can write your response in the form of a poem, haiku, limerick a short story or novella.. (or just a standard comment). As long as an entry is added as a comment, you are in with a chance of winning.</p>
<p>The winner will be picked out at random on <strong>10th April</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
<p>If you enter you <strong>MUST</strong> be able to attend the conference - I will be upset if you win and dont go. The winner will be responsible for their own hotel and airfare / travel costs.</p>
