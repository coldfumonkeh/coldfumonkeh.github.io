<p>It was after much deliberation that I came to the following decision last night. I will be leaving the powerhouse that is <a title="Visit Fuzzy Orange" href="http://www.fuzzyorange.co.uk" target="_blank">Fuzzy Orange</a> to head to pastures new and to experience alternative development roles and technologies.</p>
<p>I have accepted a really exciting position working with the <a title="BBC" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk" target="_blank">BBC</a> involving mobile development and device management for existing sites and portals. I'm really excited by the opportunities and experiences that lie ahead of me and I'm really looking forward to the new challenges that will surely pass my way.</p>
<p>I want to thank <a title="Visit andyallan.com" href="http://andyallan.com" target="_blank">Andy Allan</a>Â (<a title="Follow Andy on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/fymd" target="_blank">@fymd</a>) and <a title="Visit Fuzzy Orange" href="http://www.fuzzyorange.co.uk" target="_blank">Fuzzy Orange</a> wholeheartedly for being a great company to work for and for the various projects and experiences over the last few years. I consider Andy a great friend, and working with him has been immense fun.</p>
<p>Sadly this also means that last year's <a title="Visit Scotch on the Rocks" href="http://sotr.eu" target="_blank">Scotch on the Rocks</a> conference was my last one as organiser and being involved in an official capacity. However, this means that for future conferences I have less running around to do and more time to focus on the sessions.</p>
<p>Again, a massive thank you to Andy and FO for a great few years. I will miss working for them but I'm sure our paths will undoubtedly cross in various bars and drinking establishments, conferences and work circles for years to come.</p>
<p>Let's see what 2012 has to offer.</p>
