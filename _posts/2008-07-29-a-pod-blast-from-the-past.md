<p><img  title="The Matt Gifford Show podcast" src="/assets/uploads/2008/08/podcast-image.jpg" alt="The Matt Gifford Show podcast" />I just found a feed on Odeo to my old <a title="The Matt Gifford Show" href="http://harrison.odeo.com/channel/5478/view/" target="_blank">podcast show</a>. I didn't think that the mp3 files would be available, but those that were hosted on Libsyn are still there.</p>
<p>It was a surprise listening to a couple of shows, some cringe-worthy moments, but some really happy memories of making them, and the connections and friendships made along the way.</p>
<p>I miss doing it now... :(</p>
<p>Perhap's I'll start again.</p>
