<p>A fantastic night out, and a really fun awards party complete with karaoke and filled with memetastic awesomeness - real words, not made up at all. The categories and shortlists were picked by a handful of judges and community experts. The winners were voted for by the guests at the event itself using an app call <a title="Visit screenreach.com" href="http://www.screenreach.com/" target="_blank">Screach</a> over the wi-fi network to vote, which was pretty cool.</p>

<ul>
<li>Blog of the Year - HTML5 Doctor</li>
<li>Meme of the Year - Old Spice</li>
<li>Web we would mate with - The Wilderness Downtown</li>
