<p>Blog posts have been slim pickings from me for the past few weeks as I've been snowed under tidying up some work before the new year and finishing off a long term contract. January will bring more posts and (hopefully) more interesting topics.</p>
<p>I promise.</p>
<p>2008 has seen so many changes, personally, professionally and globally.<br />
2009 will be a great year, and I look forward to all that it brings.</p>
<p>Until then, I want to wish everyone a very Happy New Year, and may the squirrel of happiness bless your nuts in abundance. :)</p>
