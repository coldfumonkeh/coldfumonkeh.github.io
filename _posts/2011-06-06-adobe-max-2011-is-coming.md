<p>Adobe MAX is back!</p>
<p>Opening it's doors once again in Los Angeles between 1st - 5th October 2011, this is going to be a fantastic conference!</p>
<p>The sessions, labs and schedules are still in the process of being finalised and populated, but the schedule is up and registration is now open.</p>
<p>There are currently five (5) ColdFusion-related sessions listed (which you can see <a title="ColdFusion-related sessions at Adobe MAX 2011" href="https://max.adobe.com/schedule/by-session/#Product_Type=ColdFusion" target="_blank">here</a>), and I would expect there to be one or two more once everything has been finalised. There are also plenty of Flash platform sessions, including mobile device development and AS3 awesomeness.</p>
<p>Head on over to <a title="Adobe MAX 2011 registration" href="http://max.adobe.com/" target="_blank">max.adobe.com</a> to register your tickets, and gear yourself up for the best conference on planet!</p>
