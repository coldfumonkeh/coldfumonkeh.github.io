<p>Quick iterations and rapid deployment to the end user Â and consumer. This is one of the reasons why I love the <a title="Adobe Creative Cloud" href="https://creative.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Creative Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>At Adobe Max 2013, a truly <a title="Watch the recorded demo on tv.adobe.com" href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adobe-technology-sneaks-2013/sneak-peek-perspective-warp-in-photoshop/" target="_blank">amazing demo was shown during the sneaks session</a> that showed off <a title="Perspective Warp" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/learn/start/tutorials/photoshop-perspective-warp.html" target="_blank">perspective warp</a>. It was awesome.</p>
<p>Creative Cloud pushed an update to Photoshop yesterday that now includes perspective warp. Cloud deployment beats waiting for a new box set of discs to be produced, packaged, shrink-wrapped and sold, right? Right!</p>
