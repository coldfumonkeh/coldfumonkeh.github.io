<p>A quick post.</p>
<p>cf.Objective() (one of the best conferences I have ever been to and spoken at) had a call for speaker submissions, which is now closed.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, Trello was used to gather the session submissions in a publicly accessible way (I personally think it works quite well for this purpose). Voting is open for attendees and the community in general to vote for the topics they would like to see. This just goes to show that the content advisory board continue to cater the conference content around the attendee's wishes and requests.</p>
<p>All of the submitted session proposals can be found on the Trello board: <a title="cf.Objective() 2014 Call For Speakers session board" href="https://trello.com/b/4M6JSoyL/cf-objective-call-for-speakers-2014" target="_blank">https://trello.com/b/4M6JSoyL/cf-objective-call-for-speakers-2014</a></p>
<p>Make sure you head over before 12th November to vote for the sessions you want to see.</p>
