Monkeh Works are delighted and excited to be speaking at the [Into The Box](http://www.intothebox.org) conference from the fine folk at [Ortus Solutions](http://ortussolutions.com/).

This is the second year for the event (our first attending it) and attendees will have the option of coming to my session:

**Winning with Vagrant, Puppet and Chef**

The speaker line up is incredibly strong and [both tracks](http://www.intothebox.org/#sessions) in the one-day event are packed full of really useful content.

Subscribe to the [official news feed](http://www.intothebox.org/blog) for up to date news and releases and I look forward to seeing you there.
