<p>Released yesterday on the Adobe Labs site, the Adobe AIR Launchpad application is absolutely fantastic!</p>
<p>An incredibly easy application to use, it is a superb tool for introducing AIR and FLEX development to all, and lets you select on a step-by-step basis which sections of an application you would like to include in a ready-made project code base for you.</p>

<p>If you are a seasoned AIR developer, then you'll be able to quickly select what options you need and amend them to suit your tastes and requirements with relative ease.</p>
