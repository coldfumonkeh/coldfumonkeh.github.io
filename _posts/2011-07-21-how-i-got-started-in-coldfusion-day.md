<p>An important date for everyone's diary - August 1st 2011 - "How I got started in ColdFusion" day.</p>
<p><a title="View Steve's original post" href="http://www.bryantwebconsulting.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/7/20/August-1-2011-is-How-I-Started-ColdFusion-Day" target="_blank">Steve Bryant has suggested</a> what I think is a fantastic idea, and that is for everyone to write a blog post (or submit as a comment on his blog if they prefer) how they got started in ColdFusion development. It's a superb idea and a great way to dig a little deeper into the community and share some stories.</p>
<p>I'll most certainly be writing my personal entry here, to be published on the day. Great idea, Steve!</p>
<p>The simple ideas are normally the best!</p>
