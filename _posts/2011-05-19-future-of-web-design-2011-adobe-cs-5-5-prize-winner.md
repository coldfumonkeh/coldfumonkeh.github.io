<p>At my <a title="Future of Web Design 2011 in London" href="http://futureofwebdesign.com/london-2011/">Future of Web Design presentation</a> in London on Tuesday 17th May, I asked attendees to tweet using the hashtag #DarwinDev to be in with a chance of winning something special.</p>
<p>I ran out of time after the presentation to select the results live on stage, and so instead I ran the random winner generator shortly afterwards. I created a screen recording of the selection process as proof of the final winner, which you can see below.</p>
<p>The prize, donated by the fantastic <a title="Visit the Community Kitchen blog" href="http://blogs.adobe.com/community/">Community Team</a> at Adobe, is a copy of <a title="Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Web Premium" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/web.html">Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Web Premium</a>.</p>
<p>For those wondering how the selection was made, I used the same code <a title="HTML5 Giveaway Winners" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/html5-giveaway-winners">posted here</a> (with a small tweak to change the hashtag) to randomly pick the winners for the <a title="HTML5 Giveaway Winners" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/html5-giveaway-winners">HTML5 book giveaway competition</a> I held last year. A nice mix of HTML5's local storage capabilities, some nifty javascript and the use of the Twitter search API.</p>
<h2>The Winner Is...</h2>
