<p>This year sees the return of the .net awards organised by the fantastic .net Magazine.</p>
<p>Now in its 13th year, the awards are now open for public voting. Good news for Adobe, the superb Dreamweaver CS5.5 release has been nominated for <a title="Innovation of the Year" href="http://www.thenetawards.com/#num6" target="_blank">Innovation of the Year</a>.</p>
<p>I was also incredibly surprised to discover that I have been nominated for <a title="Developer of the Year" href="http://www.thenetawards.com/#num16" target="_blank">Developer of the Year</a>! This was totally unexpected, but a big honour and as you can expect I'm very excited. I would truly appreciate your support if you can spare the time to come and submit your votes for me.</p>
