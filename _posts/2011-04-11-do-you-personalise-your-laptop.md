<p>I've pushed the boat out and (shock horror) finally started adding some stickers to my MBP; the first one to go on was the awesome "I love CF" sticker that was handed out at SOTR2011.</p>
<p>So, do you / have you personalised your laptop / equipment to show a little of your personality? If so, what have you done? Share your photos and descriptions in the comments and show us your individuality :)</p>
