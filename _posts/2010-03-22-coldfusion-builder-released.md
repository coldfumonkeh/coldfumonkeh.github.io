<p>Today is a good day to code.</p>
<p>Adobe have officially <a title="Adobe ColdFusion Builder" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/cfbuilder/features/?promoid=FCRSO" target="_blank">released ColdFusion Builder</a>, the ColdFusion specific IDE.</p>
<p>I've been a devoted user of CF Builder for a good few months now after making the switch from Dreamweaver, my old IDE of choice. I must say that I haven't look back since.</p>
<p>Using Builder and the Eclipse workspace layout has drastically increased and improved my overall development in terms of time-management (things just seem quicker in CF Builder), and thanks to the ability to install Flex Builder as a plugin, all of my development can be managed and accessed through the one IDE - no need to switch to multiple applications.</p>
<h2>What's the cost?</h2>
<p>It's a deal, a steal, the sale of the century - the pricing for CF Builder is actually very impressive.</p>
<p>A copy of ColdFusion Builder will cost $299.00, and with that purchase you also receive a copy of <a title="Adobe Flash Builder 4" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/" target="_blank">Flash Builder 4</a> standard edition as part of the package. Two fantastic applications for less than I'd consider one would cost.</p>
<p>Alternatively, purchase a copy of Flash Builder 4 Premium Edition, and your package will include a license for ColdFusion Builder.</p>
<p>Whichever option you choose, you certainly get two amazing products in one package.</p>
<h2>I want it</h2>
