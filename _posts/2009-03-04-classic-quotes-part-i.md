<p>Yesterday morning in the office:</p>
<blockquote><p>Joe: "Hey, are you coming to pub this evening after work for a quick drink?"</p>
<p>Me: "I can't tonight. I'm going scuba diving"</p>
<p>** blank stares and looks of disbelief from around the office **</p>
<p>Me: "Honestly. I know it sounds like a lame exuse, but I AM going scuba diving"</p>
<p>Joe: "Ok. I'll be down the pub for a few, as soon as I finish my rock climbing class"</p></blockquote>
