<p>With the recent release of <a href="http://www.jqueryui.com" title="jQuery UI" target="_blank">jQuery UI's</a> updated version (1.8), the enhanced and extended widgets provided with the UI library offer developers and designers alike a superb framework and pre-defined interactive elements for use in wire-framing or production environments.</p>
<p>In the four-page tutorial featured in the May(170) issue of <a href="http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/" title="Web Designer Magazine" target="_blank">Web Designer magazine</a>, starting from a blank canvas, the tutorial guides the user through adding interactive elements such as the new autocomplete widget, as well as sortable lists, progress bars, and colour pickers, and a look into the widget factory to create and customise your own widgets.</p>
