<p>Iâ€™m really excited to say that I will be speaking at the <a title="Future of Web Design Prague" href="http://futureofwebdesign.com/prague-2012/" target="_blank">Future of Web Design Prague 2012</a> conference in on 29th November 2012.</p>
<p>This is the first time the FOWD event has been to Prague, and even better it is being run at the same time with the Future of Web Apps (FOWA) conference... two conferences for the price of one!</p>
<p>I always enjoy attending and speaking at the FOWD events, and I'm looking forward to meeting more awesome creative people and attending the great lineup of <a title="FOWD Prague Schedule" href="http://futureofwebdesign.com/prague-2012/schedule" target="_blank">sessions</a> from some big <a title="FOWD Prague Speakers" href="http://futureofwebdesign.com/prague-2012/speakers" target="_blank">speakers</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not already going, definitely consider it. FOWD is amazing.</p>
