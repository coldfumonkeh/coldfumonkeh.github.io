<p>I. Am. Having. A. Nightmare.</p>
<p>I'm being owned this evening by IE6 compatability issues. If I had my way, every website in the world would have a badge on it, forcing all users to switch to Firefox.</p>
<p>I've been wrestling with a site nearing completion, but trying to fix issues with Alpha Transparency on CSS controlled images as backgrounds. I cannot seem to find a fix that works. At all.</p>
<p>The application also uses a Google Map interface. However, this is causing issues in IE6 when I viewed it this evening. The maps loads up as it should, but the pointer and the control (zoom &amp; pan) icons aren't showing. I realised this was because they too are png images.</p>
<p>Firefox:</p>
<p><img title="GoogleMap Firefox" src="/assets/uploads/2009/02/ff_googlemap.png" alt="GoogleMap Firefox" /></p>
<p>IE6:</p>
<p><img title="GoogleMap IE6" src="/assets/uploads/2009/02/ie6_googlemap.png" alt="GoogleMap IE6" /></p>
<p>I want to do very bad things to IE6 developers right now, and to all IE6 users.</p>
<p>Burn them. Burn them all. **</p>
<p>If anyone knows of a way or has successfully managed to implement a fix for png alpha transparency for Internet Exploder 6, please share the wealth and knowledge. I've tried using <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" target="_blank">http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/</a> by Dean Edwards with no luck, as well as <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/supersleight-transparent-png-in-ie6" target="_blank">Supersleight</a> by Drew McLellan.</p>
<p>I appreciate any help you guys could offer. Thank yoooouuu</p>
<p>**note - if you are reading this on an IE6 browser, please don't be scared. I wont burn you. Thank you for reading to the end. Enjoy your day. I'll make you a cup of tea.</p>
