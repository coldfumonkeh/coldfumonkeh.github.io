<p>It's Friday (always awesome), and what better way to celebrate than with a competition.</p>
<p>This week's request is nice and easy; in lieu of the fact that Scotch on the Rocks 2011 is rapidly approaching us (although we have to shift through Christmas first.. *sigh*), check out the picture below from SOTR 2010:</p>

<p>Classic!</p>
<p>Simply post a caption to go with the photo in the comment box below, and the lucky winner selected at random tonight will receive an awesome, much-coveted CF Dude t-shirt.</p>
<p>Try to keep profanities to a minimum; I know what you lot are like... pure filth.</p>
<p>Aaaaannnndd... GO!</p>
