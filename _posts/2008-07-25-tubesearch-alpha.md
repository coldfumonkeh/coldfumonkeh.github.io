<p>Built around the source code for my previous FLEX/Tube app (<a title="FLEX myTube" href="../../flex/myTube/">myTube</a>), I wanted to play around with the search functionality offered by the youtube API.</p>
<p>Although only a simple application, a search is made for keywords entered, and the XML is returned from the API. Flex loops through the namespaces and groups to collect the relevant information, and the video is requested and then played.</p>
<p>You can view the (alpha) release of the <a title="tubeSearch" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/flex/tubeSearch/">tubeSearch application</a> here. Have a play around. View some videos. Enjoy! :)</p>
