<p>Scotch on the Rocks, Europe's longest running ColdFusion conference and (I think) one of the best conferences in the EU for web development in general is in full preparation for next year's conference. I'm a little biased as I've been very fortunate to be directly involved with the conference since 2009, but take my word for it, the community engagement and close knit (but welcoming) community is second to none.</p>
<p>Following a very successful <a title="Scotch on the Rocks 2013" href="http://2013.sotr.eu/" target="_blank">conference earlier this year</a> in June, we are opening the doors once more for session submissions.</p>
<p>If you would like to speak at <a title="Scotch on the Rocks 2014" href="http://sotr.eu/" target="_blank">next year's event</a>, held on the 5th - 6th June 2014, all you have to do is head over to the official <a title="Scotch on the Rocks engage application" href="http://engage.sotr.eu/" target="_blank">SOTR Engage application</a> and submit as many topics as you want to. This is open until 29th November 2014 and it's already filling up fast with some amazing session proposals, which also goes to highlight how the success of this conference has grown over the years.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://engage.sotr.eu/">http://engage.sotr.eu/</a> and start submitting!</p>
