<p>With the welcome release of Adobe AIR 2 in beta, revised APIs and additional classes and features provide end users with an enhanced experience, whilst still giving developers a simple but extremely powerful way to develop feature-rich desktop applications.</p>

<p>In the tutorial featured in the January(166) issue of Web Designer magazine, I'll guide through building an AIR 2 project from scratch, utilising the awesome new features available with the StorageVolumeInfo Class, and ending up with a file explorer application that detects the addition or removal of external drives, as well as highlighting some of the other fantastic new additions to the AIR 2 API.</p>
