<p>I'm quite excited. The first official UK Flex Camp is being held tomorrow in London.</p>
<p>It's going to be a chance to find out the latest news, techniques and information about FLEX, along side other developers and officials from Adobe. Is it wrong to be excited about such a geeky conference?</p>
<p>Hey, at least it's not Comicon! :)</p>
