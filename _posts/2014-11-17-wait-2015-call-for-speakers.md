Monkeh Works are gearing up for our first conference in 2015, [Web Applications in Trend](http://waitconference.eu).

Aimed at all creative professionals of all skill levels, we plan to bring you the best content for the modern web with sessions covering tools, processes and development methodologies as well as languages, skills and tips from some of the best speakers around.

Community is a core part of WAIT 2015 and our main focus as we plan the conference and surrounding details. As such we want the community to be a big part of this event.

If you would like to speak at this amazing event next year we are really excited to announce that the [call for speakers is officially open](http://engage.waitconference.eu).

You have until 31st December 2014 to submit your session proposals and suggestions. You are not limited and can submit as many ideas as you would like.
On 1st January 2015 we will close submissions and open the sessions to public votes, engaging with attendees and the community to help us shape their event and vote on sessions they would like to see. The final sessions will be publicly announced in February 2015.

To submit your session proposals simply head over to http://engage.waitconference.eu and log in using either your Twitter, LinkedIn or Google Plus account details.
If you do not have any of these accounts for whatever reason get in touch with Monkeh Works and we can add your session submission to the application on your behalf.

We look forward to reviewing all of the great content and to working with you to create what we are sure will be an amazing event.
