<p>An entire week of free online sessions dedicated to ColdFusion development and general awesomeness. That's right, an entire week!</p>
<p>Adobe have released the details and schedule for the ColdFusion developer week sessions - a series of webinars hosted by seasoned ColdFusion experts and industry leaders. There are a total of eleven sessions covering a wide range of topics, and will be airing live between Monday 12th September to Friday 16th September 2011. I'll be speaking on Friday covering the awesome ColdFusion as a Service features and ActionScript proxy classes.</p>
