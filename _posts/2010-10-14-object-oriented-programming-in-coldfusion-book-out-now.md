<h3>What Can I Learn?</h3>
<p>"Break free from procedural programming and learn how to optimize your applications and enhance your skills using objects and design patterns"</p>
<p><img title="Add Object-Oriented Programming in ColdFusion to your bookshelf" src="/assets/uploads/2010/10/CFOOP_Bookshelf.gif" alt="Add Object-Oriented Programming in ColdFusion to your bookshelf" style="margin-right: 30px;" />To quote from the publishers site, here is what you can learn from this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make your ColdFusion Components (CFCs) come alive with methods, using object inheritance, connecting to a database through the internal methods of our object/CFCs</li>
<li>Create a Bean object, complete with accessors and mutators to set and retrieve properties in the object, including sample code for ColdFusion 9 script components</li>
<li>Optimize and encapsulate your functions to improve code portability</li>
<li>Introduce the Bean into ColdFusion object-oriented programming design patterns, discover the benefits of code inheritance and understand polymorphism</li>
<li>Persist objects in memory throughout your applications</li>
<li>Examples of OOP concepts and basic design patterns</li>
<li>Create a service layer or façade to interact with your objects</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who is it written for?</h2>
<p>The quick, honest answer is YOU.</p>
<p>The slightly more detailed, corporate answer is:</p>
<p>"If you are a web developer wanting to implement object-oriented programming with ColdFusion, then this book is for you. If your goal is to get a good grounding in the basics of object-oriented programming concepts, this book is perfect for you. No prior knowledge of object-oriented programming is expected, but basic knowledge of ColdFusion development skills is assumed."</p>
