Exciting and daunting in equal measure, I am thrilled to announce that I'm running in the 2016 [London Marathon](https://www.virginmoneylondonmarathon.com/en-gb/).

I was lucky enough to get a place in this iconic event, which is a month before the even bigger [100km ultra](/the-big-running-challenge).

## For Charity

I am taking part in the London Marathon to raise money for [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/), and am running in memory of my amazing Grandad, George Wood, whom we sadly lost to cancer in 2014.

I have a minimum amount that I need to raise but with your help I want to get through that and raise as much money as I can for Cancer Research UK. You can REALLY help.

I have a [minimum target of £500.00](http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/marathon_monkeh) to reach. This is a minimum and I would LOVE to smash through it and raise as much as I can.

I would REALLY appreciate it if every reader of this post was able to add a little to the pot. You will not only be helping a fantastic charity do some fantastic things but also fueling my passion and desire to succeed even more. Please, consider the next latte you may not actually need and perhaps drop a few ££ or $$ into the donation bucket instead. I promise I will be eternally grateful.

I am taking donations online via my Virgin Money page for this event: http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/marathon_monkeh

When you donate (please do), make sure you select the Gift Aid option if presented with it. It will not cost you any more money but the charity will receive additional funds as a result.

Stephen Fry also thinks you should donate to me: https://www.myfundraisingfilm.com/view/3eb4acfb-cac1-416a-8e54-b636c7ed5dea

Please help wherever possible.

Thank you for your time and please consider a small donation.
