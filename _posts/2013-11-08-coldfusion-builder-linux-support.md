<p>Many developers have been asking for ColdFusion Builder support for Linux for a long time, and there have been a number of requests to the Adobe forums, bug trackers and support groups for this exact feature since it's initial release.</p>
<p>One ticket on the bugbase reappeared in my inbox yesterday dealing with this very request, but sadly not for any good reason.</p>
<p>Initially reported in 2011, "<a title="ColdFusion Builder 2.0  -  Bug 2832512 " href="https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=bug&amp;id=2832512" target="_blank">ColdFusion Builder 2 Won't Run Under Linux</a>" (bug #2832512) has been commented on by a fair number of people (24 is a fair number in my book), but sadly the ticket has been closed and the reason marked as "not enough time". Say what?</p>
<p>Come on, Adobe. Two+ years seems like more than enough time to me to add support to a plugin product that is based on Eclipse which runs beautifully on Linux. I'd love to know the actual reasons behind the closure of this ticket, as I don't buy the lack of time as a reasonable offering.</p>
<p>So, bottom line, if you're looking to use CF Builder on Linux it looks like you're out of luck. Sorry.</p>
