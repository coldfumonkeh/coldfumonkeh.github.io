<p>Issue 190 of Web Designer magazine is now available in the shops, and the main feature co-written by me discusses social networking APIs and how to integrate them into your sites or applications.</p>
<p><img title="Web Designer Issue 190" src="/assets/uploads/2011/11/WD190.png" alt="Web Designer Issue 190" /></p>
<p>In the article I show you how to utilise and implement Twitter services including web intents and the @Anywhere service. I also cover Google+, what is available to use within the actual social network, the benefit and use of the +1 button and creating custom hangouts using the API.</p>
<p>Pete Simmons covers Facebook, the Like button and implementing FBML into applications.</p>
