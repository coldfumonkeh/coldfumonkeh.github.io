<p>A fresh new CFC wrapper, written just for fun.</p>
<p>I found the BBC programme API, and it was a really nice little resource, allowing people to view programme schedules, and query the API for linked/related shows by genre or group.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a CFC wrapper for the API, mainly because I love playing with external sources, structs and feeds.</p>
<p>The '<strong>rough</strong>' <a title="(What is on) BBC CFC" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/projectLibrary/BBCAPI/">demo page for the application can be viewed here</a>, and the CFC is available to download from <a title="Download the project from riaforge" href="http://whatisonbbc.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">http://whatisonbbc.riaforge.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to create a widget, a desktop app, or a feed with your favourite shows? Never miss a BBC programme again with the help of this CFC.</p>
<p>Some may call it trivial, some may call it pointless. I just call it good old fashioned fun CF development.</p>
