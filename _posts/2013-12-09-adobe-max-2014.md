<p><a title="Adobe MAX 2014" href="http://max.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe MAX</a> is back!</p>
<p>The global creative conference is back in Los Angeles between October 4th - 8th 2014.</p>
<blockquote><p>The collision of 5,000 creative minds over three days. Expect sparks.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have never attended MAX before, you really must. It's an amazing event with great content and filled with sessions covering a vast number of Adobe creative avenues. The MAX sneaks and keynote sessions alone are typically worth the cost of entry, not to mention the MAX bash!</p>
