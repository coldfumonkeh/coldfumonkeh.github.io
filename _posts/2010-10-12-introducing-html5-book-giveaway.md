<p>Last week, I posted a <a title="View the post Introducing HTML5 Book Review" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/introducing-html5-book-review/" target="_self">review of "Introducing HTML5"</a> by Bruce Lawson and Remy Sharp.</p>
<p><img title="Introducing HTML5 Book Giveaway" src="/assets/uploads/2010/10/HTML5BookGiveaway.gif" alt="Introducing HTML5 Book Giveaway" /></p>
<p>With thanks to Bruce, Remy and the publishers, <a title="Visit New Riders" href="http://www.newriders.com" target="_blank">New Riders</a>, I am pleased to have the opportunity to share some 'development book-worm' love and have four copies of the book to give away to some lucky readers of this blog.</p>
<p>To be in with a chance to win a copy of this book, simply tweet the following message:</p>
<blockquote><p>@coldfumonkeh, introduce me to HTML5 and let me get my groove on with Bruce and Rem. #HTML5Giveaway http://bit.ly/HTML5Giveaway</p></blockquote>
<p>The winners will be selected on Friday 15th October and will be announced here in a new blog post.</p>
