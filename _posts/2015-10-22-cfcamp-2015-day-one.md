##### Language Improvements

Safe navigation operator

    if(isdefined('foo'))
    {
      writeOutput(foo.bar());
    }
    else
    {
      writeOutput'not defined');
    }


Make this easier using safe navigation operator:

    writeOutput(foo?.bar());


    writeOutput(employee?.address[1]?.street?.foo);



Ordered and Sorted collections:

    str = structNew("sorted");
    str.zero = "zero";
    str.beta = "beta";
    str.alpah = "alpha";

    // change order
    str = structNew("sorted", "desc");

<code>passArrayByReference</code> setting

<code>searchImplicitScopes</code> setting

##### CLI

cf.bat file (Windows)

file, database, email and webservice operations

arguments and named arguments can be passed to the command

<code>read()</code>, <code>writeLn()</code> and <code>writeError()</code> methods available


##### API Management Capabilities

* 63% of CF user base already expose APIs
* 34% of which are intranet APIs
* 23% or which are internet APIs
* 43% have both internet and intranet APIs

APIs being used for:

* 47% mobile enablement
* 45% driving internal innovation (reuse and cost reduction)
* 32% new channel for data, services or technology (increased reach)
* 25% customer and partner enablements
* 18% new source of revenue

APIs - from concept to go-to-market:

1. define business objectives

### Static site generation using Node.js - David Boyer

http://www.metalsmith.io/

Generate your sites dynamically, hosting static pages and sites.

Can be easily regenerated any time, anywhere.

Not tied specifically to Node.js - can use any language.

Generate your static site by script or application.

#### Why Not Dynamic?

Speed is key. Dynamic servers and apps will introduce latency and bottlenecks

<blockquote>
"Every 100ms delay costs 1% of sales" - Greg Linden - Amazon (2006)
</blockquote>

Dynamic resources add latency

* databases
* server-side manipulation

##### Security Concerns with Dynamic Apps

* secure version of your server-side language
* 3rd-party code (modules, libraries, extensions) need monitoring
* ensure server-side code is secure (parameter protected and XSS safe)

Every new additional layer to your app adds an extra point of failure.

With static sites these points of failure and bottlenecks are greatly reduced.

Running costs are much lower with static sites. HTML can be hosted anywhere (for free) with minimal layers.

#### Why Static?

* improved security - only a web server to attack
* faster, no databases or server-side processing to construct the page
* fewer points of failure
* easily cacheable or hosted across multiple servers
* easier to debug
* HTML only changes when you regenerate the content

##### Mix and Match

* static content pages mixed with dynamic server pages
* static generated site, backed by an API and client side Javascript for dynamic components
* dynamic content management system producing a static based site
* Areas of your static pages can still be dynamic using client-side JS

##### Suggested Usage (from Metalsmith site)

Metalsmith / static generation can be used for:

* project scaffolder
* build tool
* ebook generator
* technical documentation
* article / blog site
* startup / product based sites

#### Metalsmith

Recursive read of all files in the <code>./src</code> directory.

Manipulates the file data through a series of plugins.

Write the results to a <code>./buid</code> directory.

Install:

    npm init

to create package.json file (if it doesn't already exist)

    npm install metalsmith --save


##### Plugins

* provided to metalsmith through the <code>.use(fn)</code> method
* plugin is provided with a list of files found and parsed by metalsmith
* a reference to the metalsmith instance


    npm install --save metalsmith-markdown

Use YAML definitions to crate metadata.

The markdown plugin will be able to parse this information and use it when generating your site

The YAML for THIS blog post:

Many templating engines available. This blog uses Jade (as you can see from the above YAML)

    npm install metalsmith-layouts --save

The metalsmith configuration file declares which engine is used

    .use(layouts({
      engine: 'jade',
      directory: path.join(__dirname, 'templates'),
      basedir: path.join(__dirname, 'templates'),
    }))


##### Useful Plugins

* [metalsmith-more](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-more)
* [metalsmith-feed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-feed)
* [metalsmith-lunr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-lunr)
* [metalsmith-prism](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-prism)
* [metalsmith-redirect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-redirect)


** NOTE: I'll be writing up a Metalsmith article after CFCamp to document how this site is generated **

### Using ColdFusion as the Lynchpin of Modern, 3-Tiered Web Apps - Dave Gallerizzo

Define the 3-tiered architecture

* also called a layer
* should be able to be constructed separately, possibly by different teams
* each tier should contribute something different to the whole

#### Why is CF uniquely qualified to support a 3-tier architecture?

* enterprise data connectivity (SQL and Non-SQL)
* native support for implementing RESTful web services
* ease of converting data to/from JSON

#### Benefits of 3-tiered architecture

* flexibility
* maintainability
* reusability
* scalability
* reliability
* framework

#### Implementing

By default most legacy CF based applications are built in what we call a 1-tier architecture

1-tier = presentation logic, business logic and data access logic with every single request.

**Rules**

The browser is a tool, not a tier. Code which runs IN the browser is a tier.

ColdFusion applications using components to separate data access from presentation and business logic is a 2-tier architecture.

You're still accessing the data access logic directly from the presentation tier.

#### ColdFusion in a 3-tiered architecture

* delivering mobile data with CF
* creating and invoking RESTful web services
* working with HTML5 websockets

### Introduction to Data und Text Mining with Java und CFML - Kai König

#### What is data mining?

Why do we have so much data nowadays?

* cheap storage and better processing power
* legal and business requirements
* digital hoarding

<blockquote>“Data mining is the extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data. The idea is to build computer programs that sift through databases automatically, seeking regularities or patterns. Strong patterns, if found, will likely generalize to make accurate predictions on future data. … Machine learning provides the technical basis for data mining. It is used to extract information from the raw data in databases…” - Ian Witten</blockquote>


#### Learning

<blockquote>"Things learn when they change their behaviour in a way that makes them perform better in the future"</blockquote>

Types:

* classification learning
* association learning
* clustering
* numerical prediction

Thing we want to learn is the **concept**.

The output of a learning scheme is the **concept description**.

Classification learning is sometimes called **supervised learning**. The outcome is the **class**.

Examples are called **instances**.

Discrete attribute values are usually called **nominal** values, continuous attribute values are called just **numeric** values.
