<p>Scotch on the Rocks is now less than 11 days away.</p>
<p>If you haven't confirmed your place or purchased your ticket for the event yet, don't hesitate and secure one now from the official SOTR site: <a title="Scotch on the Rocks 2010" href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk" target="_blank">www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk</a></p>
<h2>We &lt;3 our sessions</h2>
<p>Covering two days, with two tracks per day, there are currently a total of <strong>22 </strong><a title="SOTR 2010 Sessions" href="http://scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/index.cfm?do=sessions.view" target="_blank">sessions</a>, bringing to you a wide range of content and topics covering ColdFusion, frameworks, working methodologies, Flex, AIR and HTML5.</p>
<h2>We &lt;3 our speakers</h2>
<p>No conference would be complete without the experts and 'purveyors of knowledge' standing up and providing the content for the sessions. This year is no exception, and we are really excited about the <strong>19 </strong><a title="SOTR 2010 Speakers" href="http://scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/index.cfm?do=speakers.view" target="_blank">speakers</a> we have lined up.</p>
<h2>We &lt;3 our badgers</h2>
<p>moving on..</p>
<h2>We &lt;3 our Reachies</h2>
<p>For the first time in SOTR history, we are holding what we hope to be an annual awards ceremony, 'The Reachies'.</p>
<p>The large number of EMEA developers work hard at what they do, and provide fantastic content, open source or not. The ColdFusion community across the globe is one of (if not) the best, open sharing communities, and we wanted to take the opportunity to highlight that fact and reward developers for their efforts.</p>
<p>There are five categories in this year's awards, and if you haven't voted, or are still unaware the awards even exist ( shame on you ), head over to the <a title="SOTR 2010 Reachie Awards" href="http://scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/index.cfm?do=nominations.view" target="_blank">nominations page</a> on the SOTR website to view the categories and place your nominations.</p>
<p>There ARE prizes for each category winner.</p>
<h2>We &lt;3 our sponsors</h2>
<p>The Scotch on the Rocks events rely on the input and support from other companies and organisations in various formats.</p>
<p>It is with this important support that the conference has been able to grow and progress year after year, and attendees have been able to enjoy the wealth of knowledge and fun of the event. A massive thank you to the sponsors of the <a title="SOTR 2010 Sponsors" href="http://scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/index.cfm?do=sponsorship.view" target="_blank">2010 event</a>.</p>
<h2>We &lt;3 the attendees</h2>
<p>Most importantly, a conference simply would not be a conference without people turning up, and we're very lucky to have a fantastic group of developers and attendees who join us for each event.</p>
<p>Ultimately, SOTR has always been undertaken with the attendees in mind, and it will continue to cater for you/them at every turn, every year.</p>
<h2>We &lt;3 doing it again</h2>
<p>I'm really excited about this years conference. A lot of work and planning has gone into the event this year ( whether the attendee's realise it or not :) ) and we've already started planning the event for SOTR2011. We must be mad, so why do it?</p>
<p>Simple. We love it.</p>
<p>Ever since SOTR was brought to life by <a title="Visit Andy's personal blog" href="http://www.andyallan.com" target="_blank">Andy Allan</a> and <a title="Visit Fuzzy Orange" href="http://www.fuzzyorange.co.uk" target="_blank">Fuzzy Orange</a> in 2005, it's been a boost for the RIA and ColdFusion community in the UK and Europe. Bringing together like-minded individuals and developers is essentially what the conference is about.</p>
<p>Whether you are there for business reasons, development ideas, educational purposes, networking, or purely as a chance to catch up with old friends and colleagues and to enjoy a beer or five, Scotch on the Rocks has always been and will always be happy to have you.</p>
<h2>We &lt;3 choice</h2>
<p>On a final note, yes, the bar at SOTR 2010 is open and drinks provided for you. There's nothing better than relaxing with a beer or two afterwards and networking, chatting, catching up with mates and having some fun. The only choice is what drink to order from the bar. :)</p>
