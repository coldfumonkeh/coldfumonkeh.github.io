<p>I have been getting back into my reading with a new found enjoyment, all thanks to CC, who has been amazing at suggesting some books that I would never normally have read (Empress Orchid, anything by Mitch Albom, and Alan Bennett in particular)</p>
<p>Below are a few of the books I have finished recently. This week alone witnessed the page-turning end of "Friends Like These" (fantastically funny), "The Uncommon Reader" (my first Bennett book), and "Tuesday's With Morrie". I would highly recommend these to anyone.</p>
