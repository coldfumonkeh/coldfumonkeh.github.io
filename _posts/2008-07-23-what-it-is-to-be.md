<p>...another year older, another year wiser (?!)</p>
<p>Yup, today is my birthday, and I've reached the grand old age of 29.</p>
<p>It's been a fantastic year. My life has changed so much, and certainly for the better. I'm much happier with where I am, professionally and personally, and I have the most amazing family. My wife has been an inspiration to me over the last 12 months, pushing my boundaries, making sure I'm out of any comfort zones when I needn't be in them. I've travelled more in the last year than I have in my entire life, and I've done things I wouldn't have normally done.</p>
<p>All in all, I feel blessed to be with the ones I am with, and feel incredibly lucky and fortunate to be where I am now, doing what I do, with the people I do them with.</p>
<p>A very happy birthday indeed. :) xxx</p>
