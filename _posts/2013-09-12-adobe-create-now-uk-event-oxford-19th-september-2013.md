<p>The Adobe Create Now World Tour is soon to be underway, and these events bring Adobe evangelists and experts to your doorstep (more or less) to show you how you can efficiently manage your projects using the Creative Cloud tools.</p>
<p>The tour itself currently has a lot of sessions across North America and Europe, but only one event in the UK (at the moment).</p>
<p>However, this UK event will be jointly hosted by Oxford Premier and Post and Digital Creatives Oxford. an Adobe User Group. This UK event will be held on Thursday 19th September 2013 @ 19:30 at Headington Hill Hall, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford. A direct link to the event on meetup.com is here: <a title="Adobe Oxford Create Now UK Event" href="http://www.meetup.com/Digital-Creatives-Oxford/events/114582262/" target="_blank">http://www.meetup.com/Digital-Creatives-Oxford/events/114582262/</a></p>
<p>One lucky attendee will win a one year subscription to the Creative Cloud!</p>
