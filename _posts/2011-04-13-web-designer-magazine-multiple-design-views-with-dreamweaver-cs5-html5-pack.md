<p>With a myriad of platforms, mobile devices and screen sizes / resolutions to cater for, the modern web designer's job is rapidly becoming more complex dealing with visual layouts to compliment the range of viewing devices now available.</p>
<p>Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 update 11.0.3 included an additional tool (the HTML5 pack) to assist in HTML5 layouts and to help simplify / streamline the creation and management of designs to cover various screen sizes.</p>
<p>In the three-page tutorial featured in the April(182) issue of <a title="Web Designer Magazine" href="http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/" target="_blank">Web Designer magazine</a>, I’ll guide the reader through creating a new project in Dreamweaver CS5 and using the Media Query window to view and manage multiple stylesheets to handle designs in various screen sizes and resolutions.</p>

<p>Issue number 182 of Web Designer magazine is out now, so make sure you grab a copy and see for yourself how Dreamweaver can assist you in designing for multiple screen sizes.</p>
