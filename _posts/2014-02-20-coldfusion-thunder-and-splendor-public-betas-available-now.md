Good times ahead.

<!-- more -->

Yesterday saw the release of ColdFusion Splendor (CF11) and Thunder (ColdFusion Builder) in public beta on <a title="Adobe Labs ColdFusion" href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion" target="_blank">Adobe Labs</a>.

If you haven't already, head <a title="Adobe Labs ColdFusion" href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion" target="_blank">over to the labs site</a> and download your copies. Experiment, get to know the feature and language updates and help shape the future of the ColdFusion engine. Now is your chance to find any potential issues, log them into the <a title="Adobe BugBase" href="http://bugbase.adobe.com" target="_blank">bugbase</a> and help the product managers and engineers build your CFML engine.

There are some really nice updates and enhancements to both of the products, details of which I will post separately in future posts so stay tuned.
