<p>It has begun.</p>
<p>I've written <a title="Things to do before I am 30" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/blog/?page_id=17">a list</a>. A list of things I would like to achieve before I turn 30, and I have started to work on some of the items on the list. The most obvious one, which <em>kind of</em> has an impact on everything else on the list, is to stop smoking.</p>
<p><img style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;" title="quit-smoking-burning-money" src="/assets/uploads/2008/09/quit-smoking-burning-money-300x221.jpg" alt="Quit Smoking" />Financially, quitting would mean that there would be approx an extra £150+ per month spending money. That's £150+ that could be used towards travel, equipment, bills, paying off debts, savings, car... anything else other than cigarettes.</p>
<p>In regards to my health, it's the most obvious step forward. Cut out the one thing that is 100% killing me. It's stupid. I'm not preaching, I've smoked on and off for over 10 years now (more on than off, sadly), but why..</p>
<p>WHY do something that you know kills you..?</p>
<p>I had quite before, and for almost three years I felt the healthiest I ever had in my life. I was going to the gym three+ times a week, circuit training, running 15km a week, yoga, body combat classes, swimming. I know the benefits of stopping, but equally I know how difficult it is to stop.</p>
<p>After a rocky weekend of on-off smoking, yesterday I took the plunge, and am focusing on quitting 100%. No half-deals, no "rewards" of a smoke at the end of the day. Full-on quitting. It's one step closer to the aim of improving life, and the well-being of not only me but others around me.</p>
<p>Bring it on. I'm ready. :)</p>
