<p>I love to read. I'm not the quickest at it (not that I read whilst moving my lips and scanning each word with my finger, either), but I want to try something different than my normal stack of books.</p>
<p>So, what books do you recommend? Any titles that you have really enjoyed? I'm open to all genres.</p>
<p>Hit me with your suggestions!</p>
