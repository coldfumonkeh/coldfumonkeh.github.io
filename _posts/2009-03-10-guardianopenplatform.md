<p>**UPDATE TWO -  a revised post has been made to reflect changes made to the API, and it's been updated (finally): <a title="Visit the revised Guardian API CFC post on mattgifford.co.uk" href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/guardianopenapi-upgrade/" target="_self">http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/guardianopenapi-upgrade/</a></p>
<p id="heading-alone">**UPDATE - the CFC is now available for download from riaforge project page here: <a title="http://guardianopenplatform.riaforge.org/" href="http://guardianopenplatform.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">http://guardianopenplatform.riaforge.org/</a></p>
<p>Woot! A new API has been <a title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/mar/10/guardian-open-platform" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/mar/10/guardian-open-platform" target="_blank">announced</a> today ('<strong>Guardian launches Open Platform tool to make online content available free</strong>').</p>
<p>The service,  called Open Platform,  'will allow partners to reuse guardian.co.uk content and data for free and weave it "into the fabric of the internet"'.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, there is a CFC wrapper available for it already.  :)</p>
<p>It's amazing how quickly you can code something when you have reusable, modular code. From reading the announcement a little over two hours ago, the component took 15 mins to create and compile. For an initial version of a CFC wrapper, that's not a bad turnaround time. :)</p>
<p>Posted to riaforge within the last few minutes, as soon as it's approved, I'll post the download URL.</p>
