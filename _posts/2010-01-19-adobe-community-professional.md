<p>I am incredibly excited and very happy to announce that I have been awarded the honour of becoming an Adobe Community Professional in ColdFusion.</p>
<p>Formerly known and recognised as an A.C.E (Adobe Community Expert), the name has been changed to A.C.P to ensure that the Adobe Certified Experts and Adobe Community Professionals are recognised separately.</p>
<p><img title="ColdFusion Rocks!" src="/assets/uploads/2010/01/cfRocks_Rourke-300x200.png" alt="ColdFusion Rocks!" /></p>
<p>This year, 300 developers and community members were awarded the ACP title, 51 of which were from the ColdFusion community, and a further 59 members added to the Flex programme.</p>
<p>A full list of 2010 Community Professionals can be found here: <a title="http://lizfrederick.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-acps-for-2010.html" href="http://lizfrederick.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-acps-for-2010.html" target="_blank">http://lizfrederick.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-acps-for-2010.html</a></p>
<p>A very strong presence of ColdFusion is a great thing to see, and I really look forward to the rest of the year and seeing what the community produces.</p>
<p>It is a major honour to be included in the list of fantastic developers and active minds in the community.</p>
<p>My life as a ColdFusion developer started by reading and learning from a good portion of the people on this list, and I still do.</p>
<p>You never stop learning, never stop asking. Web and application development is about pushing boundaries, discovering new techniques, new processes.. asking 'what if I did this?'.  For me, ColdFusion has always been the platform from which I can do those things, and it never lets me down.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to contributing more to the community in the form of blog posts, magazine articles and tutorials, publications and conferences, including <a title="Scotch on the Rocks" href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/" target="_blank">Scotch on the Rocks 2010</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like to say a massive thank you to a few people for their help and assistance over the last few years and to Adobe;  Claude Englebert, Liz Frederick and all at the Adobe Community Programme, Adam Lehman and Terry Ryan, Kev McCabe, Cate Stewart-Gifford @ <a title="Gorilla Works" href="http://www.gorillaworks.co.uk" target="_blank">Gorila Works</a>, and Andy &amp; Leanne Allan @ <a title="Fuzzy Orange" href="http://www.fuzzyorange.co.uk" target="_self">Fuzzy Orange</a>.</p>
<p>Here's to a fantastic 2010!</p>
